### Challenges (you can include images and code block here)
1. Not changing the CSS or HTML files, I couldn't use `getElementBygetElementById` or  `getElementBygetElementByClass` to reference the individual squares.
2. Winning conditions - I didn't know how to compare the two arrays (Player & Winning condition).

### Learning points
1. I used `getElementBygetElementByTag` for the first challenge. From this, I referenced each element through a `for` loop as this `getElementBygetElementByTag` is an array.
